### Important ⚠️

Please keep in mind that a macro calculator provides only an **estimate**, and individual variations, medical conditions, and other factors may require personalized adjustments. Therefore, it's always a good idea to consult with a registered dietitian or nutritionist for a more detailed and tailored nutrition plan based on specific needs and goals.
